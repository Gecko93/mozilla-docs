# HTML is Not a programming language
**markup language**
  * tells browser how to structure websites
  * KISS Keep It Simple Stupid
  * DRY Dont Repeat Yourself
  * ex. My cat is very grumpy
      <p>My Cat is very grumpy</p>
## Block Level Elements Vs Inline
  * **Block-Level Elements** form a visible block on a page 
    * appear on a new line
    * structural elements on the page
      * paragraphs lists navigation menus footers etc
    * **block level element wouldnt be nested inside an inline element but it might be nested inside a block element**
  * **Inline Elements** are those contained *within block-level elements* and surround small parts of the document
    * An inline element will **not** cause a new line to appear in the document
    * Normally appears inside paragraph of text:
      * Ex: <em>first</em><em>second</em><em>third</em>
            <p>fourth</p><p>fifth</p><p>sixth</p>
        * <em> is an inline element while <p> is a block element
        * ![MarkDown] (./images/example-1.png)


## Best Practice:
 Best practice, however, is to write **all tags in lowercase** for consistency, readability, and other reasons.
